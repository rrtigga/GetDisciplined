GETDISCIPLINED IS ON THE GOOGLE PLAY STORE: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spicycurryman.getdisciplined10.app

#GetDisciplined is the only app you need to stay focused!

GetDisciplined allows you to block any selected app on your phone for a set amount of time up to 24 hours! Due to Google constantly changing their API's and the methods for getting running tasks and running apps (for Android-L and the coming M) on devices and other projects and pressing work in my life I have chosen to open-source the application rather than letting it die out completely. 

I encourage other developers to potentially improve it, use it in their own personal projects, and help me re-release it to users. I will still occasionally update this app based on my free time, but it will probably be beta quality code.

If you are a developer who's interested in using GetDisciplined's current codebase, I encourage you to fork this repository and/or directly contribute to it. If you decide to launch your own fork of GetDisciplined on the Play Store, feel free to drop me a line so I can feature it on this GitHub page.

Ever sat down to do work and promised yourself not to be distracted by your smartphone this time?! Next thing you know twenty minutes have passed and you already sent a couple SnapChats to your friends, checked all your Facebook messages, and looked at cute cat pictures on Reddit.

It’s this simple: 

1) Drag the scrubber to set the amount of time for how long you want the apps to be blocked for
*(Press the hour time and drag the scrubber to set the time for hours. Press the minute time and drag the scrubber to set the time for minutes)*

2) Press the list button and check the distracting apps you want to block
