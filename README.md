Ever sat down to do work and promised yourself not to be distracted by your smartphone this time?! Next thing you know twenty minutes have passed and you already sent a couple SnapChats to your friends, checked all your Facebook messages, and looked at cute cat pictures on Reddit.

GetDisciplined allows you to block any selected app on your phone for a set amount of time up to 24 hours!

It’s this simple: 

1) Drag the scrubber to set the amount of time for how long you want the apps to be blocked for
*(Press the hour time and drag the scrubber to set the time for hours. Press the minute time and drag the scrubber to set the time for minutes)*

2) Press the list button and check the distracting apps you want to block


3) Press the timer button to start the time

You won’t be able to use those checked apps until the time runs out! 

Block your most time-wasting apps in seconds and stay productive for hours!

Say goodbye to procrastination.

IT’S TIME TO GETDISCIPLINED!
